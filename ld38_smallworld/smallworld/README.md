-----------------

This is my LUDUMDARE 38 entry for the JAM for LudumDare 38 "Small World". It was nearly a 
compo entry, it was done solo and all assets were created during the compo and source is 
available. But I needed the extra day to make it playable. :)

Source code is available at:
https://github.com/joeld42/ld48jovoc/tree/master/ld38_smallworld

Compo Page is here:

Instructions:
--------------
Be the last team standing on (what's left of) the planet.

- WASD or ARROWS to control tilt and heading. 
- Hold LEFT SHIFT to turn faster.
- Hold Space, X, or Z to charge, release it to fire. 

Or use the mouse to drag AIM and TILT sliders, and then press and
hold the FIRE button to charge, release it to fire.

If you would like to be notified of post-compo releases of my games,
including possibly this one, ping me on twitter or email, or join the
Tapnik mailing list at http://tapnik.com/ (at the bottom).
