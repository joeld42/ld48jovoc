             <p>
                 LD41-Matrix is an experiment by Joel Davis. Ludumdare 41 had
                 a really interesting theme, "Combine two incompatible genres", and
                 that created a ton of game ideas and prototypes. I though this would
                 make an interesting visualization of what combinations were popular,
                 and provide an neat way to browse through the large volume of games.
                 Also it was an excuse to play with some web technologies that I
                 wanted to try.
