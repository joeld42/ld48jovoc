Shufflefish is a DeckBuilder + Fishing Sim. 

--------
INSTRUCTIONS: 
When each card is flipped, you can drag it to a few places to play it:

- REEL: If you have a fish on the hook, drag any card to the "Reel" diagram at the top of the screen. 
The green number on the top of the card is how many spaces it will reel in.

- Each space a fish is reeled in increases the line tension by one. Too much tension and the line will break.

- Any other action will not advance the fish, and line tension will decrease by 1. 
If the line gets too slack the fish will get away.

- Drag a card to the Trash Can to discard it. 

- If it's a TACKLE card, drag it to your tackle box (bottom left of screen). You can only
have five cards total in your tackle box and you can't replace them.

- If it's an ACTION card, drop it on the lake to take the action specified. You may also Trash
an action card to continue without taking the action.

- If it's a FISH card, you may drag it to the lake. It will be added to the lake to be caught later.

- Drag a CAST card onto the lake to cast. Cast will put a fish from the lake (if any are present) on your line.
If you already have a fish on the line, you will let it go.
