LD46 "Home Fires" by Jovoc (Joel Davis)
-----------------

This is my pretty incomplete entry to LD46. 

- Hold RMB to look around 
- WASD or Arrow keys Move
- Space or E to pickup logs / interact with shrines

The goal is to bring logs to all the shrines so they are all lit. 
The logs will burn up over time.

Keep the home fires burning!

You can change the music/sfx volume in the config file
