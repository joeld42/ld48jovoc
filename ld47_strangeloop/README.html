	<p>
		Strange Loop is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is to create one continous loop that wraps
		around the whole shape. The touches every cell, but might not touch every corner dot. There are
		hints marked on the board, using those hints and some logical deduction, you can solve the whole loop!
	</p>
	<p>
		This is inspired by games like <a href="https://www.puzzle-loop.com/">Puzzle Loop</a> aka Slitherlink or <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/loopy.html">Loopy</a>. Check out these games for more hints and strategies!

	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		Strange Loop was created for LudumDare 47 over the course of 72 hours, by Joel Davis (joeld42@gmail.com).
		<br>
		It was built using the <a href="https://github.com/floooh/oryol">Oryol Engine</a> and my 
		<a href="https://github.com/joeld42/darkstar">terrible basecode.</a> Follow

	<h1>How To Play</h1>
	<p>
		When you start the game, some cells are marked with symbols. 
		<ul>
			<li>A blank cell is unlabeled, and gives you no clues for the puzzle.</li>
			<li>A cell with a CIRCLED X means none of the edges are part of the loop (but the corners may be)</li>
			<li>A cell with one square has exactly one edge that is part of the loop</li>
			<li>A cell with two square has exactly two edges that is part of the loop</li>
			<li>A cell with three square has exactly three edges that is part of the loop</li>
		</ul>
		You may mark some edges with a red X, this is not required to solve it but it can help you keep track
		of which edges you know are empty. Some edges start out marked as part of the loop or as X'd out, these
		marking can't be modifed.
	
	<h2>Controls</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Drag the puzzle to rotate it</li>
		<li>Click on an edge to cycle it between BLANK, MARKED, and X'd OUT</li>		
		<li>Shift-Click on a marked edge to make it blank</li>		
		<li>Shift-Click on a blank edge to make it X'd out</li>		
		<li>Press the "Check" button when you think you've solved the puzzle.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Cheat Codes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Press 0 to enable cheat codes.</li>
		<li>Press 'D' to toggle overlay display of the solution</li>
		<li>Press 'B' to fill in the edges with the correct solution</li>
	</ul>	
	</p>
	<h2>Strategy</h2>
	<p>It can be hard to figure out where to put the line. Here's an example:</p>
		<br><img src="docs/logic1.png" width="300"><br>
	<p> Here, we see two cells with three marks next to each other. Since these can't
	form a closed loop (since the whole solution is a single loop), we know the open edge
	can't be between them, so they must make an S or a backwards S shape. Since we can see
	one marked edge on the top of the S, we can tell it's not a backwards S and can fill
	in the shape.</p>
	<p>
		Next, since we've marked the top of the S and there is cell with one mark there, 
		we can mark the other three edges on the one cell as open. That only leaves one
		direction for the loop to continue from the top of the S, so we extend it.
	</p>
	<p>Now just keep doing that until you've solved the whole puzzle!</p>
